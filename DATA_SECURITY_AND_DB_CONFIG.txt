📊 CURRENT EVENT/SUB-EVENT DATA FLOW ANALYSIS
🔍 Current Database Schema:
Looking at the Event model in the schema, there are NO soft delete or status fields:
model Event {
  id            Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  title         String
  description   String?
  location      String
  startTime     DateTime
  endTime       DateTime
  rsvpDeadline  DateTime
  maxAttendees  Int
  hostId        Int
  createdAt     DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime     @updatedAt
  // NO status, isDeleted, deletedAt, or archive fields
}

🗑️ Current Deletion Flow:
1. Manual Deletion by Host:
// DELETE /api/events/:id
router.delete('/:id', authenticateToken, authorizeHost, async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Delete all related records first
  await prisma.invitation.deleteMany({ where: { eventId } });
  await prisma.feedback.deleteMany({ where: { eventId } });
  await prisma.rsvp.deleteMany({ where: { eventId } });
  await prisma.registration.deleteMany({ where: { eventId } });
  await prisma.waitingList.deleteMany({ where: { eventId } });
  
  // 2. Delete sub-events if mega event
  const subEvents = await prisma.event.findMany({ where: { parentEventId: eventId } });
  for (const subEvent of subEvents) {
    // Delete all sub-event related records
    await prisma.invitation.deleteMany({ where: { eventId: subEvent.id } });
    await prisma.feedback.deleteMany({ where: { eventId: subEvent.id } });
    await prisma.rsvp.deleteMany({ where: { eventId: subEvent.id } });
    await prisma.registration.deleteMany({ where: { eventId: subEvent.id } });
    await prisma.waitingList.deleteMany({ where: { eventId: subEvent.id } });
  }
  await prisma.event.deleteMany({ where: { parentEventId: eventId } });
  
  // 3. Finally delete the main event
  await prisma.event.delete({ where: { id: eventId } });
});

2. Automatic Cleanup (Scheduled):
// Run every day at midnight
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', async () => {
  const oneMonthAgo = new Date();
  oneMonthAgo.setMonth(oneMonthAgo.getMonth() - 1);
  
  const oldEvents = await prisma.event.findMany({
    where: { endTime: { lt: oneMonthAgo } }
  });
  
  // NOTE: Currently only logs, doesn't actually delete
  console.log(`Found ${oldEvents.length} old events to archive`);
});

📋 Current Data Retention Policy:
✅ What Gets Stored:
All event data (title, description, location, timing, etc.)
All participant data (RSVPs, registrations, waiting lists)
All feedback and interactions
All invitations and notifications
All payment proofs and QR codes
All custom fields and responses
❌ What Happens on Deletion:
PERMANENT DELETION - Data is completely removed from database
NO RECOVERY - Cannot be restored once deleted
CASCADE DELETE - All related records are also permanently deleted
NO ARCHIVING - No backup or archive is created
⚠️ Current Issues & Gaps:
1. No Soft Delete:
Events are permanently deleted when host deletes them
No way to recover accidentally deleted events
No audit trail of deleted events
2. Incomplete Auto-Cleanup:
Scheduled cleanup only logs old events but doesn't delete them
No automatic deletion of expired events
Database will grow indefinitely with old event data
3. No Data Retention Policy:
No defined retention period for event data
No compliance considerations for data privacy
No backup strategy for important event data
4. No Archive System:
No way to archive old events for historical reference
No analytics on past events
No learning from event history
🔄 Recommended Improvements:
1. Add Soft Delete Fields:
model Event {
  // ... existing fields
  isDeleted    Boolean   @default(false)
  deletedAt    DateTime?
  deletedBy    Int?      // User ID who deleted it
  status       String    @default("active") // "active", "deleted", "archived"
}
Apply to SubEventDeta...
2. Implement Proper Auto-Cleanup:
// Archive events older than 6 months
const sixMonthsAgo = new Date();
sixMonthsAgo.setMonth(sixMonthsAgo.getMonth() - 6);

await prisma.event.updateMany({
  where: { 
    endTime: { lt: sixMonthsAgo },
    isDeleted: false 
  },
  data: { 
    status: "archived",
    updatedAt: new Date()
  }
});

// Delete archived events older than 2 years
const twoYearsAgo = new Date();
twoYearsAgo.setFullYear(twoYearsAgo.getFullYear() - 2);

await prisma.event.deleteMany({
  where: { 
    status: "archived",
    updatedAt: { lt: twoYearsAgo }
  }
});
Apply to SubEventDeta...
3. Add Data Retention Policy:
Active Events: Keep for 6 months after end date
Archived Events: Keep for 2 years for analytics
Deleted Events: Soft delete for 30 days, then permanent deletion
Payment Data: Keep for 7 years for tax compliance
📊 Summary:
Current State:
❌ No soft delete - permanent deletion
❌ No data retention policy - indefinite storage
❌ Incomplete auto-cleanup - only logging
❌ No archive system - no historical data
Data Flow:
Event Created → Stored in database permanently
Event Expires → Remains in database (no auto-cleanup)
Host Deletes → PERMANENTLY DELETED with all related data
No Recovery → Cannot restore deleted events
Recommendation: Implement soft delete, proper data retention policy, and archive system for better data management and compliance.
